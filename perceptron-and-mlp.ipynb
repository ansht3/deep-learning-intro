    "Based on the data here as well as the results, I see that for the single layer model it is linearly separable, and because of that the model drops in terms of the loss rate. For the multi layer model, it has more like the hidden lists and the multiple activation functions, which adds more complexity to the model. Because of this, the learning rate is slower and thus that means that the loss rate will be even more steeper. So with that, the multi layer model is better in terms of loss rate decrease and it converges faster compared to the single layer model."

    "The test accuracy that I reached on the test data was approximately 92.5%. Based on that, this is valid because I set up a simple multi layer perceptron with using ReLU for the hidden layers. The training loss definitely was steep and went down, as in the beginning Epoch at 0, it was as 2.31, but then it went down after 50 epoch's to 0.48, which indicates that the learning was useful and the optimizer worked properly. To improve the performance, I would to improve the learning rate or improve the way I am doing the forward or backward pass for each epoch which can optimize performance. Not only that, lowering the learning rate that can also improve accuracy. I also experimented with adding more hidden layers, but that made it harder to optimize once I tried. Also, when I tested with 200 epochs I saw that at Epoch 0 the loss immediately was at 0.26 and then by Epoch 190 it was 0.07 the loss.  This shows that model steadily converged during the training."
