# Deep Learning ML Projects

- Perceptron (Single and Multilayer). Python script to implement a single perceptron using PyTorch, and then extending to a Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) architecture. Applying MLP to classification task using MNIST dataset.
- Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). Python script building and training a CNN in PyTorch for handwritten digit classification on MNIST.
